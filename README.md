# Toggle Restricted Jira Comments

A browser extension to hide restricted Jira issue comments.

## Why?

Ever wanted to share your Jira screen with a client or co-worker, but not wanted them to see internal / restricted comments?

This browser extension adds a button to the activity feed to let you toggle the visibility of restricted Jira issue comments. 

This allows to share your screen without sharing restricted / sensitive information.
